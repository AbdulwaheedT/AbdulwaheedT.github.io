Throughout the duration of this task, I undertook the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst engaged in a practical, real-world project. I demonstrated proficiency in Python, a widely utilized programming language renowned for its application in data science and analysis. Python programming language and other libraries were used, including Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Plotly.
